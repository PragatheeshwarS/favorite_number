## Working of this assignment <br />
The login page and the registration page was developed using HTML, CSS and JS. <br />
I have used Mongodb for storing data handling  <br />

Initially the register page will be rendered, where you can toggle to login too. <br />
After registering you can login, you see the details only if you login as admin, if you login as normal user you can see only "Login Successful" message. <br />
