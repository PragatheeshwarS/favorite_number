##Working of this assignment
The login page and the registration page was developed using HTML, CSS and JS.
I have used Mongodb for storing data handling 

Initially the register page will be rendered, where you can toggle to login too.
After registering you can login, you see the details only if you login as admin, if you login as normal user you can see only "Login Successful" message.
